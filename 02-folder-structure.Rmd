# Lecture 2

## Identifying when data does not have any dependencies (i.e. all observations are independent of each other) versus when data has complicated dependencies (i.e. longitudinal data, matched data, multiple cohorts)


## Identifying when mixed effects regression models should be used

## Identifying when conditional logistic regression models should be used

## (TBD) Understanding the different imputation methods used when lab data is below the limit of detection (LOD)

## (TBD) Understanding the best practices for data files and project folders
