# Matching

## In case control studies

The aim of matching is to find controls with similar observable characteristics to the cases. This reduces bias due to confounding [@rubin_matching_1973].

These studies can be analysed using either conditional logistic regression or mixed effects logistic regression (with random intercepts for each matched stratum).

## In non-case control studies

The aim of matching is to find non-exposed observations with similar observable characteristics to the exposed observations. This reduces bias due to confounding [@rubin_matching_1973].

These studies can be analysed using mixed effects regression (with random intercepts for each matched stratum).
