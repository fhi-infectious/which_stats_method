# Syllabus

## Logistics

Instructor: Richard White [richard.white@fhi.no]

Time: 09:00 - 11:45, 18th September 2017

Location: Main auditorium, L8, Lindern Campus

Language: English

## Format and Procedures

09:00 - 10:00: Lecture 1

10:00 - 10:10: Break

10:10 - 11:10: Lecture 2

10:10 - 10:15: Break

11:15 - 11:45: Real examples from FHI

## Rationale and Course Aims

This course will provide a basic overview of general statistical methodology that can be useful in the areas of infectious diseases, environmental medicine, and labwork. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify appropriate statistical methods for a variety of circumstances.

Note: This course will **not** teach students how to implement these statistical methods, as there is not sufficient time.

## Course Specific Learning Outcomes

Lecture 1

1. Identify continuous, categorical, count, and censored variables
2. Identify when your data does not have any dependencies (i.e. all observations are independent of each other)
3. Identify when your data has complicated dependencies that need to be taken into account (longitudinal data, clustered data, matched data)
4. Identify when linear and logistic regression models should be used
5. Identify when poisson, negative binomial, and cox regression models should be used

Lecture 2

6. Identify when mixed effects regression models should be used
7. Understand the similarities between t-tests, ANOVA, and regression
8. Understand the different imputation methods used when lab data is below the limit of detection (LOD)
9. Understanding best practicies for data files and project folders

## Course Requirements

To participate in this course, it is recommended that you have some experience with either research or data.

For the last 30 minutes of the course, we will be going through examples of analyses performed at FHI, and identifying which statistical methods are appropriate. If you would like your analysis to be featured/included in this section, please send an email to richard.white@fhi.no briefly describing your problem.
