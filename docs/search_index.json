Richard White 2017-06-07 Chapter 1 Syllabus 1.1 Logistics Instructor: Richard White [richard.white@fhi.no] Time: 09:00 - 11:45, 18th September 2017 Location: Main auditorium, L8, Lindern Campus Language: English 1.2 Format and Procedures 09:00 - 10:00: Lecture 1 10:00 - 10:10: Break 10:10 - 11:10: Lecture 2 10:10 - 10:15: Break 11:15 - 11:45: Real examples from FHI 1.3 Rationale and Course Aims This course will provide a basic overview of general statistical methodology that can be useful in the areas of infectious diseases, environmental medicine, and labwork. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify appropriate statistical methods for a variety of circumstances. Note: This course will not teach students how to implement these statistical methods, as there is not sufficient time. 1.4 Course Specific Learning Outcomes Lecture 1 Identify continuous, categorical, count, and censored variables Identify when your data does not have any dependencies (i.e.Â all observations are independent of each other) Identify when your data has complicated dependencies that need to be taken into account (longitudinal data, clustered data, matched data) Identify when linear and logistic regression models should be used Identify when poisson, negative binomial, and cox regression models should be used Lecture 2 Identify when mixed effects regression models should be used Understand the similarities between t-tests, ANOVA, and regression Understand the different imputation methods used when lab data is below the limit of detection (LOD) Understanding best practicies for data files and project folders 1.5 Course Requirements To participate in this course, it is recommended that you have some experience with either research or data. For the last 30 minutes of the course, we will be going through examples of analyses performed at FHI, and identifying which statistical methods are appropriate. If you would like your analysis to be featured/included in this section, please send an email to richard.white@fhi.no briefly describing your problem. "],

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., . Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
