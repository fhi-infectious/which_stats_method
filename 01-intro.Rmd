## Variable types

### Continuous variables

A variable is continuous there is a meaningful "distance" between values.

### Categorical variable

A variable is categorical if there is no meaningful "distance" between values.

### Censored variables

Censored variables are a subset of continuous variables

### Count variables

Count variables are a subset of continuous variables.

## Hypothesis testing

In science, we are interested in testing hypotheses. Statistics allows us to formally test our hypotheses.

In statistical testing we have a **null** hypothesis ($\text{H}_0$) and an **alternative** hypothesis ($\text{H}_1$). We assume the null hypothesis is true and try to find the probability of what we have observed (or something more extreme). If our observations are very unlikely (assuming the null hypothesis is true) then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

For example:

$\text{H}_0$: It is summer

$\text{H}_1$: It is not summer

Our observed data for today is an average temperature of -20C today. Assuming it is summer, how likely is it that today's average temperature will be -20C? Not very likely! We therefore reject $\text{H}_0$ ("it is summer") in favor of $\text{H}_1$ ("it is not summer"). That is, we conclude that it is not summer today.

## t-tests

### What is a t-test?

A t-test compares the means of two groups.

$\text{H}_0: \mu_0 = \mu_1$

$\text{H}_1: \mu_0 \ne \mu_1$

Or rephrased:

$\text{H}_0$: The average height of men is equal to the average height of women

$\text{H}_1$: The average height of men is not equal to the average height of women


### Paired t-test

### Unpaired t-test

## Identifying when non-parametric t-test equivalents should be used

## Identifying when ANOVA should be used

## Identifying when linear regression should be used

## Identifying the similarities between t-tests, ANOVA, and regression

## Identifying when logistic regression models should be used

## Identifying when Poisson/negative binomial and cox regression models should be used

## Identifying when chi-squared/fisherâ€™s exact test should be used
