# Survey data

## Obtaining coefficients via regression modelling {#survey-coefs-regression}

If your data comes from a complex survey (i.e. stratified sampling, two-stage, clusters, etc.) then you should make your regression model reflect the sampling strategy that was used to bias your sample away from the population [@gelman_struggles_2007].

## Obtaining population estimates via regression modelling

You should begin by forming a model as explained in Chapter \@ref(survey-coefs-regression) And then use this model make estimates for each group. Then perform a weighted average [@gelman_struggles_2007].
