# Variable Types

## Continuous Variables

A variable is continuous there is a meaningful "distance" between values.

For example:

- Temperature
- Weight
- Height
- BMI
- Blood pressure

## Binary Variables

A variable is binary if it can only hold two values.

For example:

- 0 or 1
- True or false
- Male or female
- Sick or healthy
- Born in Norway vs Born outside of Norway
- 
\hfill \break
\hfill \break
- 
\hfill \break
\hfill \break

## Categorical Variable

A variable is categorical if there is no meaningful "distance" between values.

For example:

- Sick or healthy
- Born in Norway vs Born outside of Norway
- Cancer stage (I, II, III, or IV)
- BMI category (underweight, normal, or overweight)
-

## Censored Variables

Censored variables are a subset of continuous variables. They are artificially cutoff ("censored") at some point.

For example:

- Height -- if everyone over 175cm is recorded as "175+"
- Age -- if everyone under 10 years old is recorded as "<=10"
- Time alive since receiving illness diagnosis if there is loss to followup (i.e. we know that the person has lived at least 4 years before we lost track of them)
-

## Count Variables

Count variables are a subset of continuous variables. They can only have integer values (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3).

For example:

- Number of cars that use the parking lot in a day
- Number of influenza patients who use the hospital every day
- Number of tuberculosis patients who are screened every year
-

## Independent Versus Dependent Variables

An independent variable is often called an exposure or predictor variable. In an experiment, this variable is manipulated by the researcher.

A dependent variable is often called the outcome. In research, we generally want to see if (the following all mean the same thing):

- The dependent variable is dependent on the independent variable
- The predictor variable predicts the outcome.
- The exposure affects the outcome

For ease of understanding, we will use the terms "outcome" and "exposure" for the rest of this course.
